# TeamRCF Website
This website was made for my rock climbing team which contains an unfinished forum.
please be aware that this was my first attempt at coding ever and I was learning these languages as I was going along.
This website displays me breaking into programming by challenging myself to create a working website for my rock climbing 
team at the time. This includes informational pages about the team, a contact page, and a working forum for coaches, parents,
and climbers to converse. Although not all of these specifications may have been met perfectly, this project was a 
great way for me to get into programming. Throughout the site, I gained experience in JavaScript, node.js, HTML, CSS,
PHP, and SQL. I also experimented with apache servers to host the forum.
