# TeamRCF Website
This website was made for my rock climbing team which contains an unfinished forum.
This website displays me breaking into programming by challenging myself to create a working website for my rock climbing 
team at the time. This includes informational pages about the team, a contact page, and a working forum for coaches, parents,
and climbers to converse. Although not all of these specifications may have been met perfectly, this project was a 
great way for me to get into programming. Before beginning this website I had no experience whatsoever with programming, although by the end of the project, I felt a bit more confident with my abilites. I gained a reasonable amount of experience in HTML, CSS, SQL, and PHP. I also gained a bit of experince working in JavaScript, bootstrap, JQuery, and Apache.
